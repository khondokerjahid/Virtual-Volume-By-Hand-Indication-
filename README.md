# Virtual Volume Control-By-Hand-Indication-
Hand gestures are a hot topic in the vision community, with the sign language recognition and 
human-computer interface applications. One of the first tracking systems focused on articulated 
hand movements. Their technology, which retrieved point and line data from grayscale pictures, 
allowed them to monitor a 27-degree-of freedom hand at 10Hz. However, it has trouble tracking 
in the presence of occlusions and complex backdrops, and it requires a human initialization step 
before it can start monitoring.
The majority of hand tracking research has thus far concentrated on 2D interfaces from an 
interaction standpoint [18] and used low-cost web cams to follow a finger around a planar region 
to handle a standard graphical interface without requiring a mouse or keyboard. Fingertip 
identification was achieved by fitting a conic to rounded features, and local tip tracking was 
accomplished with Kalman filtering.
Similarly, infrared cameras were utilized to divide skin regions from background pixels to track 
two hands on a 2D tabletop display for interaction. After that, their system used a template 
matching approach to recognize a small set of motions that might be translated as interface 
commands.
